Known Issues:

1) Tags with no text or attributes should not be generated, but should be reported.

2) Tags with a title attribute can use title for a locator.  They may not be unique but I'm also using className
which often won't be unique.  These should be controlled via a configuration option.

3) Must deal with sibling-position when computing css locators.

4) Need to configure the logs to rewrite each time.

5) Command-line options
-logs (default)
-log="classname"
-noLogs
-generate
-analyze
-analyze-generate (default)
-url="http://xxxxx"
-pageOnly (default)
-fullSite
-useTitleAttributes


6) Filtering is done via:
    a) Template config file must list the tag
    b) Tag must have either attributes or non-empty text.


7)  How can I distinguish if a <div> requires a click?

8) An analysis file could get out of date, what does that mean for generation?


9)  Bug: Can't find the Facebook title tag when I'm logged into FB.

10) Enhancement: Remove underscores from the filename.

11) We begin a CSS Locator path when an ID is found or we hit the <body> tag while traversing up a Node's
ancestor chain.  I could configure it to handle NAME attributes, this should be configurable in case Names are not
unique. We don't consider attributes other than IDs or Names because no others can be assumed to be unique.  I should
 add a configuration to specify an attribute other than ID or Name.


12)  Bugs found writing locators:
    For the textless <p> with no attributes, this returned true but should have been false.
    For some reason, <li>s exist with attributes that can't be used as locators, but doesn't generate a css either.


13) Node vs. Element.  Node is the more general base class.  Element is a tag, it's closing tag, it's contents, and attributes.


14) When there's no <title> the generated page object file name defaults to uielement1
