A) to deploy a jar

1 have precompiled classes.

2) from root  .. jar -cvmf manifest.mf com(src package root) selGen.jar
one line i nthe manifest.mf file that says the main class.
I must create this.
3) to execute java -jar selGen.jar

search Google for manifest file main class.


B) Configure Tomcat to point to the project

In the conf folder add an xml file who's name corresponds to the URL path after the hostname-port.
For example:
- I added the file "TomcatRoot"/conf/Catalina/localhost/testpages.xml
- It's content defines a Context which sets the URL path and sets the 'docBase' attribute to the desired filepath.

<Context path="/testpages" docBase="/Users/pgrandje/IdeaProjects/selgen/resources/testpages"/>


I got info from this thread:
    http://www.coderanch.com/t/87763/Tomcat/Configuring-context-CATALINA-HOME-webapps
And from their docs:
    http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/engine.html
